   - Use the `/newbot` command and follow the instructions
   - Save the API token provided by BotFather

2. **Start a chat with your bot:**
   - Find your bot on Telegram and start a conversation
   - This is necessary for the bot to be able to send you messages

3. **Get your Chat ID:**
   - Message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot) on Telegram
   - It will reply with your Chat ID

4. **Configure Notifications:**
   - Add these values to your `.env` file:

     NOTIF_ENABLE=True
     NOTIF_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
     NOTIF_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here
     ```

## Usage

### Create a Session

Before running the monitor, you need to create a session:

```bash
piepaymon create-session
```

This will guide you through entering your phone number and OTP to create a session.

### Run the Monitor

Start the monitoring service:

```bash
piepaymon run
```

The service will continuously check for new offers matching your criteria and notify you when found.

### Exit the Monitor

Press `Ctrl+C` to gracefully stop the monitoring service.

## Important Note

**You need two PiePay accounts for this tool to be most effective:**
1. One account for monitoring deals
2. One account for actual transactions

You must maintain the same cards in both accounts for them to show identical deals. The monitoring account will detect profitable offers, and you can then use the transaction account to make the actual payments.
